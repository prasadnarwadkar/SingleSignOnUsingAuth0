# Single Sign On Using Auth0
This is an example of using Auth0 to implement user management and single sign on (SSO) in an ASP.NET MVC application. There are two applications created. When user logs on to the first application, they are automatically logged on to the second application. It uses simple configuration and a client id for an Auth0 app. Take a look at [this page](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/aspnet-owin) to know more.

## Auth0 side of the configuration & Get Your Application Keys
When you signed up for **Auth0**, a new application was created for you, or you could have created a new one. You will need some details about that application to communicate with Auth0. You can get these details from the Application Settings section in the **Auth0** dashboard. After that, you can do some settings as stated in [here](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/aspnet-owin#configure-auth0).
